If provided, top-gh-contribs will pull down your list of releases from github and look for the date of the matching release.\n* `releaseDate` ::\n    A date, in milliseconds (ala `Date.now()`) from which to count releases. Takes precedence over `releaseTag`\n\n    If neither `releaseTag` nor `releaseDate` is provided, all commits in the last year will be counted.\n* `count`\n    The number of contributors to return. If not specified, all contributors will be returned.\n* `retry`\n    Default `false`.  If `true`, the request will be retried in the event GitHub returns a status of 202\n    (retry momentarily).\n",
